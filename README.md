# magebit_test
In this repository I am making the site based on the Magebit requirements.
Here I have not fully done the project but main part of it is working pretty good.
For me the biggest challenge was with php table. 
  Making of the search field ,appearing pills with email domain,pagination.

In this file there is no table with  sorting, previously it was , but I found the code where all requirements above where written.
For me it was really big challenge and experience. I surely know that this is not the best job , but for me this my biggest step at the moment.
At the moment of this code I did not know about SASS but know I am already coding in SASS instead of CSS.
Right know I am taking internship in front-end, but I will be very glad if you will rate my job and will be very glad if you will accept me to your internship.
I am last year student RTU and that is why I have a lot of free time and I am trying to get more coding knowledges.
Thank you and waiting for your email.

Sincerely,
Riad.
